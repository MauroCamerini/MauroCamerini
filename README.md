# **Hey! I’m Mauro** 👋

- 🚀 **What I do:** I’m a Help Desk Analyst at [Provincia Net](https://www.linkedin.com/company/provincia-net), where I provide technical assistance to end users, clients, and vendors
- 💻 **Development:** I got into coding young. In recent years, I dove into full stack web development with Node.js and React. I'm comfortable working with APIs and SQL databases.
- 🙌 **Working with people:** 15+ years in client-facing roles has taught me that tech is as much about people as it is about code.
- 🤝 **Looking for:** A team where I can jump in and bring my development knowledge and user-focused approach to bridge technical support and software solutions.

## What I'm Working On
**Desktop React SQL Ledger:** A portable desktop app to keep track of my income and expenses, built with **Electron** (just like Discord or Microsoft Teams). The UI is made with **React** (using React Router, React Hook Forms, and Bootstrap), and all the data is stored locally in an **SQLite** file for easy access.
