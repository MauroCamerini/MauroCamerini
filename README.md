# **Hey! I’m Mauro** 👋

- 🚀 **What I do:** I’m a Help Desk Analyst (Level 1) at [Provincia Net](https://www.linkedin.com/company/provincia-net), tackling tech challenges and making things work smoothly for users every day. I provide technical assistance to end users, clients, and vendors
- 💻 **My skills:** I got into coding young, and I’m always leveling up. Recently, I dove into full-stack development—React, Angular, Node.js—and I'm comfortable working with APIs and SQL databases. I love seeing how everything connects and making it all run seamlessly.
- 🙌 **Working with people:** 15+ years in client-facing roles has taught me that tech is as much about people as it is about code. Whether it's a user or a teammate, I’m here to help and keep things moving.
- 🤝 **Looking for:** A dynamic team where I can jump in, solve problems, and bring my technical know-how and client-focused approach to the table.

## What I'm Working On
**Desktop React SQL Ledger:** A portable desktop app to keep track of my income and expenses, built with **Electron** (just like Discord or Microsoft Teams). The UI is made with **React** (using React Router, React Hook Forms, and Bootstrap), and all the data is stored locally in an **SQLite** file for easy access.
